# E-Commerce React Site by Hayden White
This is a project made for my bootcamp, Coding Temple. In this project, in a good way, I was forced to study with my own resources and figure out React. The assignment called for a basic ecomm site with products, prices, etc. It also calls for simplicity in my work for now, so this project is simply a landing page with 4 products, working buttons that open an order now form, and a contact form + Header/Footer.

### NOTICE
Node is a part of the project files, but GH would not let me upload many files/folders in Node, so be sure to have Node/NPM. I will reattempt uploading the file. In the meantime, I hope you can get the site working properly. I do not know how the lack of node is going to affect
